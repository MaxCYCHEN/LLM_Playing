The M463/M467 series runs up to 20 0 MHz,  and fea tures 1.7 V to 3.6  V wide operating \\nvoltage, -40 °C to 85 °C /105°C  /125°C  wide operating temperature, a variety of packages choice, and \\nexcellent high immunity characteristics by ESD HBM 2  KV and EFT 4.4  KV.  \\nAs the new smart function added o n home appliances, the  M463/M467 series provides up to 1024 KB \\ndual-bank of Flash memory for code storage and 512 KB SRAM for run time op eration. The dual bank \\ndesign of 1024 KB Flash memory supports the Firmware update through the Over -The-Air (FO TA) \\nprocess. Additionally, in response to the code security requirements, the M463/M467 series supports  \\nExecute -Only Memory (XOM) function to protect confidential program code information from stealing in \\nthe run -time. In order to reduce the data access ove rhead of CPU core to peripherals, up to 32 channels  \\nof peripheral direct memory access (PDMA) is provided.  \\nThe M463/M467 series supports plenty of peripherals, including  Ethernet 10/100 MAC , hardware crypto \\nengine, key store, true random number generator ( TRNG) , programmable audio PLL, H yperBus \\ninterface , 4 sets of CAN FD,  USB HS OTG, USB FS OTG , up to 24 channels of 16 -bit PWM, 10 sets of \\nUART, 4 sets of SPI/I2S, 2 sets of Quad -SPI, 5 sets of I² C,  1 set of USCI, 1 set of PSIO, 4 sets of EQEI \\nand a real-time clock (RTC).  \\nThe M463/M467 series also provide s rich analog peripherals including  4 sets of analog comparators, \\nup to 2 8 channels of 12 -bit SAR ADC, and 2 channel s of 12-bit DAC.  \\nFor the development, Nuvoton provides the NuMaker -M467HJ, NuMaker -M463KG evaluation board , \\nand Nuvoton Nu -Link debugger. The 3rd Party IDE such as Keil MDK, IAR EWARM, Eclippse IDE with \\nGNU GCC compilers are also supported.  \\nProduct  Line Core  \\n(MHz)  Ethernet  Crypto \\n+ TRNG  CAN  \\nFD USB  \\nOTG  HBI EBI UART  I2C QSPI/ SPI PWM  ADC  DAC  ACMP  EQEI  \\nM463 Series  200 - √ 2 HS x1  - √ 8+1 5 SPI x4  \\nQSPI x2  24 16 - 2 2 \\nM467 Series  200 √ √ 4 HS x1  \\nFS x1  √ √ 10+3  5 SPI x4  \\nQSPI x2  24 28 2 4 4 \\n \\nThis series supports eleven  package choices which are designed for home appliance PCB demands.  \\n\\uf06c QFN48: Body Size 5 mm x 5 mm, Load  pitch: 0.35 mm  \\n\\uf06c LQFP48: Body Size 7 mm x 7 mm, Load  Pitch 0.5 mm  \\n\\uf06c LQFP64: Body Size 7 mm x 7 mm, Load  Pitch 0.4 mm  \\n\\uf06c LQFP128: Body Size 14 mm x 14 mm, Load Pitch 0.4 mm  \\n\\uf06c LQFP144: Body Size 20 mm x 20 mm, Load  Pitch 0. 5 mm  \\n\\uf06c LQFP176: Body Size 24 mm x 24 mm, Load  Pitch 0.5 mm  \\n\\uf06c LQFP48 EPAD: Body Size 7 mm x 7 mm, Load Pitch 0.5 mm, EP Size 5.36 x 5.36 mm' metadata={'source': './docs/en-us--TRM_M463_M467_Series_EN_Rev1.01.pdf', 'page': 35}\n"
